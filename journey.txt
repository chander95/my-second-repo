My favorite moment while doing the Coding Temple Software Engineering course has been learning to program. I especially like that there are a multitude of projects to practice what we are learning. I am very much looking forward to learning how to put everything together and build a fully functional application web-based or otherwise. I have been using VScode text editor during this course but I have also enjoyed using Atom text editor in the past.
